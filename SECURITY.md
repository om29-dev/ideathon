# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

The AI Finance Assistant takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly by:

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainer
2. **Private Issue**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub
3. **Direct Contact**: Reach out through project communication channels

### What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Your contact information

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Backend Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **CORS Protection**: Configured cross-origin resource sharing
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have appropriate rate limits
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information leakage

### Frontend Security
- **Data Sanitization**: User inputs are properly sanitized
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data uses secure storage mechanisms
- **Network Security**: HTTPS enforcement for production
- **Permission Management**: Minimal required permissions requested

### API Security
- **Authentication**: Secure API key management for external services
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation on all endpoints
- **Response Filtering**: Sensitive information filtered from responses
- **Logging**: Security events are logged appropriately

## 🔐 Best Practices

### For Developers
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow secure coding practices
- Regularly run security audits
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper error handling

### For Users
- Keep the application updated
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Review permissions before granting
- Report suspicious activity
- Backup your data regularly

## 📋 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🔄 Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible
- Clearly documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Announced through project communication channels
- Backwards compatible when possible

## 🛠️ Security Tools

We use various tools to maintain security:

### Backend
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability checker
- **pip-audit**: Python package auditing

### Frontend
- **Flutter Analyze**: Dart/Flutter code analysis
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular dependency updates

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- API keys are stored locally (consider secure vault in production)
- Local data storage without encryption (consider encryption for sensitive data)
- No user authentication system (consider adding for multi-user scenarios)

### Planned Improvements
- Enhanced encryption for local data
- User authentication and authorization
- Advanced API security measures
- Security audit logging
